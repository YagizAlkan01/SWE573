      <h2>Issues met while uploading Python</h2>
      <h5>Python Installation, Mar 3, 2022</h5>
   
      <p>While uploading Pyhton, I met with "Pyhton can not found" problem. I met this problem because I have downloaded Pyhton via Anaconda before. Path of Anaconda was not uploaded correctly.</p>

      <h5>Solution</h5>
      <p>I removed Anaconda from computer. I downloaded Pyhton 3.10. Also removed all the Paths from the system. I added new Path for the Pyhton.</p>
